Here is the playable game: https://tytygamedev.itch.io/winner-stay-on-fixed

I made this in a 3 day game jam, where the theme was Soccer! I made the whole thing except the audio. It is built off an algorithm based on individual and 
opponent stats to determine how the game plays out. Hope you enjoy!
